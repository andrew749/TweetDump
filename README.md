# Tweet Dump

A simple script to dump random tweet data from twitter.

I found this as a useful way to get realtime tweets (from a random sample)
since there doesn't seem to be any good data sets out there. This script will
dump all the data twitter returns about the tweet.

## Prerequisites

- Folder in the root of this project named `dump`.

## Usage

```
python dump_data.py
```

Nothing too crazy.
